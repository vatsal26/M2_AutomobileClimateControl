# SENSOR

# Temperature sensor (Thermistor or Heat sensor

* Thermistors are a very accurate and price- powerful sensor for measuring temperature.it is the NTC thermistor this is normally used to measure temperature
Resistence produces alternate in voltage, this voltage is taken as input to micro controller.

# 1.3 ACTUATORS

# LCD Display
* It displays the value of tempreature

# LED
* A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it

# 1.4 MICRO CONTROLLER
*  An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and that controls the whole system. 
* Atmega-328 is used as per the project requirement

# 1.5 Power Supply
* The DC energy supply powers Microcontroller and different components in the gadget. right here i am the use of 5V Dc deliver to energy the circuit.

# 1.6 Push Button Switch
* Push button switch is connected to the microcontroller through a switch inorder to limit the flowing current.
